# Interactive Analysis of The Census of India, 2011
* * *

## Description

This project presents an interactive dashboard for geospatial data analysis of the tips dataset using Python, Plotly, and Streamlit. The dataset contains visualization of 2011 India Census data at the district level and overall country level. The app allows users to interactively explore demographic insights such as population, literacy rates, gender ratio, and more.

### The dashboard features contain interactive visualization:-

#### 1. üó∫Ô∏è Choropleth Map (District-Level Visualization):
Displays district-wise data from the 2011 Census (e.g., population, literacy rate, gender ratio, etc.) overlaid on the map of India.
Each district is color-coded based on the selected metric, providing a clear visual comparison across regions.

#### 2. üìä National-Level Overview:
Alongside the map, summary statistics for all of India are presented for selected indicators ‚Äî giving users both micro (district) and macro (national) insights.

#### 3. üéöÔ∏è Feature Filters and Selection Options:
Users can choose from multiple census indicators (such as total population, rural/urban population, literacy rate, etc.) using dropdowns. Filters may also include state-wise selection to zoom into specific states or regions, updating both the map and summary analysis accordingly.

#### 4. üß≠ Interactive Exploration Tools:
Hovering over districts displays exact data values via tooltips.
The map supports zooming, panning, and real-time updates based on selected filters.
